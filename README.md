Started with [Webpack React Boilerplate by Hashem Khalifa](https://github.com/HashemKhalifa/webpack-react-boilerplate)

Details in [boilerplateReadme.md](./boilerplateReadme.md)

I chose this starter kit because I have used it before with good results, and because it uses most of the same tools I would choose if I were setting up this project from scratch:

* [Webpack 4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) 
* [Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel) [ transforming JSX and ES6,ES7,ES8 ]
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) `16.6`
* [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) [ Unit test]
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for UI testing.
* [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/) with airbnb config
* [Style](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) & [CSS Loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) & [SASS-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader)
* [React hot loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
* [Webpack dev serve](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) 

I removed the Prettier code formatter and CSS modules configuration because I don't wish to use them.
